DIABETES MELLITUS

Definition:
Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both.

Types:
1. Type 1 Diabetes (T1DM):
   - Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells leading to absolute insulin deficiency
   - Usually diagnosed in children and young adults
   - Requires lifelong insulin therapy
   - Accounts for 5-10% of all diabetes cases

2. Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM):
   - Progressive insulin secretory defect on the background of insulin resistance
   - Most common form (90-95% of all diabetes cases)
   - Often associated with obesity, physical inactivity, and family history
   - May be managed with lifestyle modifications, oral medications, and/or insulin

3. Gestational Diabetes:
   - Glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy
   - Affects 2-10% of pregnancies
   - Usually resolves after delivery but increases risk for T2DM later in life

4. Other Specific Types:
   - Genetic defects of beta-cell function or insulin action
   - Diseases of the exocrine pancreas (e.g., pancreatitis)
   - Endocrinopathies
   - Drug or chemical-induced

Diagnostic Criteria:
1. Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L)
2. 2-hour Plasma Glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during OGTT
3. HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol)
4. Random Plasma Glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) in patients with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia

Prediabetes:
- FPG: 100-125 mg/dL (5.6-6.9 mmol/L) - Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG)
- 2-hour PG: 140-199 mg/dL (7.8-11.0 mmol/L) - Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT)
- HbA1c: 5.7-6.4% (39-47 mmol/mol)

Clinical Manifestations:
- Polyuria (increased urination)
- Polydipsia (increased thirst)
- Polyphagia (increased hunger)
- Unexplained weight loss
- Fatigue
- Blurred vision
- Poor wound healing
- Recurrent infections

Complications:
1. Acute:
   - Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) - primarily in T1DM
   - Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) - primarily in T2DM
   - Hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) - treatment-related

2. Chronic:
   - Microvascular:
     * Diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease)
     * Diabetic retinopathy (eye disease)
     * Diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage)
   - Macrovascular:
     * Coronary artery disease
     * Peripheral arterial disease
     * Cerebrovascular disease
   - Other:
     * Diabetic foot ulcers
     * Increased susceptibility to infections
     * Skin conditions
     * Gastrointestinal issues

Management:
1. Lifestyle Modifications:
   - Medical nutrition therapy
   - Regular physical activity
   - Weight management
   - Smoking cessation

2. Pharmacological Therapy:
   - Insulin therapy (various types and regimens)
   - Oral antidiabetic medications:
     * Biguanides (e.g., metformin)
     * Sulfonylureas
     * Meglitinides
     * Thiazolidinediones
     * DPP-4 inhibitors
     * SGLT-2 inhibitors
     * Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors
   - Injectable non-insulin medications:
     * GLP-1 receptor agonists
     * Amylin analogs

3. Monitoring:
   - Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)
   - Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
   - Regular HbA1c testing
   - Regular screening for complications

4. Education and Support:
   - Diabetes self-management education
   - Psychological support
   - Regular medical follow-up

Prevention:
1. Primary Prevention (preventing diabetes):
   - Healthy diet
   - Regular physical activity
   - Maintaining healthy weight
   - Avoiding tobacco use

2. Secondary Prevention (preventing complications):
   - Good glycemic control
   - Blood pressure control
   - Lipid management
   - Regular screening for complications

3. Tertiary Prevention (preventing disability):
   - Early treatment of complications
   - Rehabilitation
   - Adaptive strategies

Special Considerations:
1. Pediatric Diabetes:
   - Unique challenges in management
   - Impact on growth and development
   - Transition to adult care

2. Diabetes in Pregnancy:
   - Preconception counseling
   - Tight glycemic control
   - Monitoring for complications
   - Management during labor and delivery

3. Diabetes in Older Adults:
   - Risk of hypoglycemia
   - Polypharmacy concerns
   - Functional status considerations
   - Modified treatment goals

4. Diabetes in Hospital Settings:
   - Glycemic targets
   - Insulin protocols
   - Perioperative management
   - Transition back to outpatient regimen
