HYPERTENSION (HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE)

Definition:
Hypertension is a chronic medical condition characterized by persistently elevated arterial blood pressure. It is defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 130 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 80 mmHg according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines.

Classification:
1. Normal: SBP < 120 mmHg and DBP < 80 mmHg
2. Elevated: SBP 120-129 mmHg and DBP < 80 mmHg
3. Stage 1 Hypertension: SBP 130-139 mmHg or DBP 80-89 mmHg
4. Stage 2 Hypertension: SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg
5. Hypertensive Crisis: SBP > 180 mmHg and/or DBP > 120 mmHg

Types:
1. Primary (Essential) Hypertension:
   - No identifiable cause
   - Accounts for 90-95% of all cases
   - Influenced by genetic and environmental factors

2. Secondary Hypertension:
   - Results from an identifiable underlying condition
   - Accounts for 5-10% of all cases
   - Common causes include:
     * Renal disease (renal parenchymal disease, renovascular disease)
     * Endocrine disorders (primary aldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, pheochromocytoma, thyroid disorders)
     * Obstructive sleep apnea
     * Coarctation of the aorta
     * Medications (NSAIDs, oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, decongestants)
     * Substance abuse (cocaine, amphetamines)

Risk Factors:
1. Non-modifiable:
   - Age (risk increases with age)
   - Family history
   - Race/ethnicity (higher prevalence in Black populations)
   - Genetic factors

2. Modifiable:
   - Obesity
   - Physical inactivity
   - Unhealthy diet (high sodium, low potassium)
   - Excessive alcohol consumption
   - Tobacco use
   - Stress
   - Certain medications

Clinical Presentation:
- Often asymptomatic ("silent killer")
- When symptomatic, may present with:
  * Headache (particularly occipital, morning)
  * Dizziness
  * Visual disturbances
  * Chest pain
  * Shortness of breath
  * Nosebleeds
  * Flushing

Diagnostic Evaluation:
1. Blood Pressure Measurement:
   - Office measurements (multiple readings on different occasions)
   - Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM)
   - Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)

2. Basic Evaluation:
   - Complete history and physical examination
   - Laboratory tests:
     * Complete blood count
     * Urinalysis
     * Blood chemistry (electrolytes, creatinine, glucose)
     * Lipid profile
     * Thyroid function tests
   - 12-lead electrocardiogram

3. Additional Evaluation (when indicated):
   - Echocardiogram
   - Renal ultrasound
   - Plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels
   - 24-hour urinary metanephrines
   - Sleep study
   - Renal artery imaging

Complications:
1. Cardiovascular:
   - Coronary artery disease
   - Left ventricular hypertrophy
   - Heart failure
   - Arrhythmias (especially atrial fibrillation)
   - Aortic aneurysm and dissection

2. Cerebrovascular:
   - Stroke
   - Transient ischemic attack
   - Vascular dementia

3. Renal:
   - Chronic kidney disease
   - End-stage renal disease

4. Ophthalmologic:
   - Hypertensive retinopathy
   - Vision loss

5. Hypertensive Emergencies:
   - Hypertensive encephalopathy
   - Acute coronary syndrome
   - Acute heart failure with pulmonary edema
   - Aortic dissection
   - Eclampsia

Management:
1. Lifestyle Modifications:
   - Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet
   - Sodium restriction (< 2.3 g/day)
   - Regular physical activity (150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity activity)
   - Weight reduction
   - Limiting alcohol consumption
   - Smoking cessation
   - Stress management

2. Pharmacological Therapy:
   - First-line agents:
     * Thiazide diuretics
     * Calcium channel blockers (CCBs)
     * Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)
     * Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)
   - Second-line agents:
     * Beta-blockers
     * Alpha-blockers
     * Central alpha-2 agonists
     * Direct vasodilators
     * Aldosterone antagonists

3. Treatment Thresholds and Goals:
   - General population:
     * Initiate at ≥ 140/90 mmHg
     * Goal < 130/80 mmHg
   - High cardiovascular risk or established cardiovascular disease:
     * Initiate at ≥ 130/80 mmHg
     * Goal < 130/80 mmHg
   - Older adults (≥ 65 years):
     * Consider comorbidities and frailty
     * Goal SBP 130-139 mmHg

4. Special Populations:
   - Diabetes mellitus: Goal < 130/80 mmHg
   - Chronic kidney disease: Goal < 130/80 mmHg
   - Heart failure: Goal < 130/80 mmHg
   - Pregnancy: Different medications and goals

5. Resistant Hypertension:
   - Defined as BP above goal despite adherence to ≥ 3 antihypertensive medications
   - Evaluate for secondary causes
   - Consider spironolactone as fourth-line agent
   - Consider referral to hypertension specialist

Prevention:
1. Primary Prevention:
   - Regular blood pressure screening
   - Healthy lifestyle habits
   - Management of other cardiovascular risk factors

2. Secondary Prevention:
   - Adherence to treatment regimen
   - Regular monitoring
   - Addressing barriers to control

Follow-up:
- Monthly follow-up until blood pressure at goal
- Every 3-6 months once at goal
- Annual comprehensive assessment
- Regular screening for target organ damage and complications

Patient Education:
- Understanding the condition and its risks
- Importance of medication adherence
- Home blood pressure monitoring techniques
- Recognition of warning signs requiring medical attention
- Lifestyle modification strategies
